# Pure Product (findpureproducts.com)
## Summary
findpureproducts.com is the only website that combines information about the safety of cosmetics ingredients with information about how irritating those ingredients can be to skin, since toxic ingredients can be gentle and gentle ingredients can be toxic. Through information from both EWG (safety rating) and Paula's Choice (gentle rating), as well as the Sephora user rating, we are able to determine a baseline of whether cosmetics are safe for users. This streamlines a typically arduous process, and allows users to find products that will work for them that are also safe and gentle to use.
